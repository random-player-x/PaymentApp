# Build a basic version of a Paytment app

I have made a very basic payment app - just for practice, I have used: 
## express 
## nodejs 
## tailwind 
## react 
## mongodb (mongoose) 

=> I have also added user-authentication using the jsonwebtokens - so that u can make your account and login - a token will be returned and then only you can access the site contents.
 <br><br> => Also used session and transaction methods in mongoDb.
