# Build a basic version of a Paytment app

I have made a very basic payment app - In this you can create an account and access the dashboard where there would be a list of other users who have made accounts, you can send money to any user you want from the list. there is a search suggestion filter - You will get filtered users depending on the initial letters you type to search.

I have used: 
## express 
## nodejs 
## tailwind 
## react 
## mongodb (mongoose) 

=> I have also added user-authentication using the jsonwebtokens - so that u can make your account and login - a token will be returned and then only you can access the site contents.
 <br><br> => Also used session and transaction methods in mongoDb in order to make transaction more secured end to end.
